List of features to implement:
- method to read data from a sample file into a table in the database
- Incorrectly formatted tab file throws an IOException, and doesn't crash (i.e., this exception should be caught
by another part of the program)
- platform-agnostic file separators
- classes for tables, rows, columns, keys, table names, column names, data values, ids and relationships between entities.
- column names are stored in a case-sensitive way, but are case-insensitive for the purpose of querying

List of things to test for:
- incorrectly formatted tab file throws an IOException
- incorrectly formatted tab file does not result in a server crash
- file separators work on any platform
